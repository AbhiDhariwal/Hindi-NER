# Hindi-NER

How to build Hindi NER using SpaCy. Detailed Code in Jupyter Notebook. 
Project uses CoNLL format for text input for training and testing or you can directly use SpaCy format.

Why SpaCy ?

SpaCy is open source and production level library .
Best part is it has customizable pipelines which makes task handy. Low latency at production side.

### Currently is does not support Indian languages so I have made a alternate method which you can use.

If you want more tutorial on SpaCy just raise issue I will upload it.
